# Zodiac-Calculator
program that determines zodiac sign based on input given by the user

Created this program using Spyder on a Friday (11/16/18)
Took me some time to figure out how to ensure that the date that can be inputed stays with the range of the days in the month
first tried using range function, but it did not work and would end up print both possible zodiac signs for the given month
went with a if and statement along with elif and else
also had to figure out how to make sure the birth day would be stored as an int and not a str 
because i kept of getting prompts that i cannot do for example: 1>=22 because the input was stored as a str so that took most of my time developing this
hope you enjoy
